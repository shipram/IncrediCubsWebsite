When I’m not doing robotics, I love to read and write stories, play with my friends and animals (especially dogs and cats!) My friends and I enjoy building safe homes in the wilderness for wild animals. We also spend time outside exploring nature. I enjoy dancing—especially contemporary and hip-hop. I love basketball as well! I am on the Skyline girls basketball team." },

I love being part of my robotics team because it gives me a chance to be creative, solve real world problems, while having fun with my teammates and friends.\nSome of my favorite parts of robotics are coding, adding onto attachments, and helping with the Innovation Project. I enjoy thinking outside the box and finding new ways to improve our robot or our team's ideas. Whether I’m programming or putting together pieces.\nWhen I’m not doing robotics, I love to read and write stories, play with my friends and animals (especially dogs and cats!) My friends and I enjoy building safe homes in the wilderness for wild animals. We also spend time outside exploring nature. I enjoy dancing—especially contemporary and hip-hop. I love basketball as well! I am on the Skyline girls basketball team.\nI am always excited to learn, create, and challenge myself both inside and outside of robotics." },
